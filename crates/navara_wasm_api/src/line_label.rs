//! Pure numeric kernel for placing text labels along a line.
//!
//! Sibling of [`crate::declutter`]: everything here is a CPU mirror of what
//! `sdfText.vert.glsl` does with the same data.
//!
//! Four decisions per label, all of which depend on the camera and so cannot
//! be baked when the tile is parsed:
//!
//! - **flip** — whether to walk the label's path backwards, so a name never
//!   reads right-to-left on screen (`keepUpright`).
//! - **fit** — whether the label is short enough to sit on the line at all.
//!   With `sizeInMeters: false` a label's world length grows as the camera
//!   pulls back, so a name that fits when zoomed in can overrun its road when
//!   zoomed out.
//! - **angle** — whether the line bends too sharply under the label to stay
//!   readable (`maxAngle`).
//! - **scale** — whether the anchor's level is the one on screen: along-line
//!   anchors are nested levels of density, each shown over a band of ground
//!   metres per pixel, so `spacing` holds in screen pixels wherever the camera
//!   is (see `navara_parser::line_placement`). A symbol longer than about
//!   three quarters of `spacing` asks for a sparser level, as MapLibre stretches
//!   `symbol-spacing` (see [`requested_meters_per_px`]).
//!
//! ## Label layout
//!
//! Labels arrive as a flat `f64` slice, [`LINE_LABEL_STRIDE`] values each, with
//! their path samples in a parallel `f32` slice of `2 * samples` values each:
//!
//! | offset | field | meaning |
//! |--------|-------|---------|
//! | 0,1,2  | anchorX/Y/Z | ECEF anchor in meters, before the height offset |
//! | 3      | addHeight | surface-normal height offset (meters) |
//! | 4      | reachEm | farthest the text's ink runs from its anchor along the line, in ems |
//! | 5      | fontSize | px or meters, per `sizeInMeters` |
//! | 6      | sizeInMeters | `0.0` = px, non-zero = meters |
//! | 7      | maxAngleRad | largest turn allowed within the sliding window; `0` = straight only |
//! | 8      | keepUpright | `0.0` = never flip, non-zero = flip when backwards |
//! | 9      | stepMeters | straight-line distance between adjacent path samples |
//! | 10     | halfExtentMeters | real line either side of the anchor |
//! | 11     | bearingRad | the line's tangent at the anchor, clockwise from north |
//! | 12     | isFlipped | the label's current flip, for hysteresis |
//! | 13,14  | minX/maxX | the label's unrotated box along its baseline, over its glyphs' ink |
//! | 15,16  | minY/maxY | the same across it, +Y up, in the font's own units |
//! | 17     | lineOffset | shift off the line along its ground normal, in the font's own units |
//! | 18     | flatFacing | `0.0` = upright, non-zero = flat, as resolved for this label |
//! | 19,20  | minMpp/maxMpp | the `(min, max]` ground metres per pixel the anchor shows over |
//! | 21     | widthEm | the label's full drawn length along the line, in ems |
//! | 22     | wordReach | half the widest word's length, in the font's own units |
//! | 23     | facesCamera | non-zero = each glyph is its own word and turns with the camera |
//!
//! `reachEm` rather than the width because the anchor need not be the text's
//! centre: with `center.x = 0` the whole label runs off one side of it, and it
//! is that side that has to fit on the line. The caller owns the `center`
//! arithmetic (it also builds the box), so it hands over the larger of the two
//! sides.
//!
//! All three horizontal measures are the glyphs' ink, not their advances: a
//! glyph can overhang its advance, and it is the ink that has to stay on the
//! line and inside the box.
//!
//! `lineOffset` and the text's own height are kept apart because they need not
//! run along the same axis: the shader always moves the text off the line
//! across the ground, but stands its glyphs up along the surface normal unless
//! the label lies flat.
//!
//! ## Result layout
//!
//! | offset | field |
//! |--------|-------|
//! | 0      | flip — walk the path backwards |
//! | 1      | rejected — out of its scale band, does not fit, or bends too far |
//! | 2,3,4,5| minX/maxX/minY/maxY of the *rotated* box, +Y up |
//! | 6      | ground metres per screen pixel at the anchor, for the caller's repeat test |
//!
//! ## Two phases
//!
//! The fit test needs no path samples at all — only the anchor, the label's
//! width, the length of line under it and its scale band — while the samples
//! are by far the largest thing crossing the boundary. Most labels on a dense
//! view fail that test, so sending every label's path first would waste most
//! of the transfer.
//!
//! [`line_label_fit`] therefore runs that test alone over a compact input, and
//! the caller packs paths only for the labels that survive it. Both phases go
//! through the same [`fits`], so they cannot disagree about how long a
//! label is; [`line_label_place`] repeats the test rather than trusting its
//! caller, which keeps it correct on its own and lets it be called with every
//! label when the split is not worth it.
